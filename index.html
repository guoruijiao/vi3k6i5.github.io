    <p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Vikash Singh</span>.</p>
    <p>I work as a Data Scientist @ <a href="https://belong.co/">Belong.co</a>.</p>
    <p>I like helping people and solving their problems. This has earned me over 3000 reputation on
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/3027854/vikash-singh">@Stackoverflow</a> and over 67K people reached :)</p>

    <h2>Open Source Projects:</h2>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/vi3k6i5/flashtext">FlashText</a></h3>
    <p>FlashText can search and replace keywords from text really fast. The algorithm is independent of number of terms. Hence the more number of terms we have in corpus the faster FlashText is in comparison to Regex. The repository has over 800 Stars :) (Have you stared it yet?)</p>
    <p> I have published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00046">paper on FlashText</a></p>
    <p> I published a <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/regex-was-taking-5-days-flashtext-does-it-in-15-minutes-55f04411025f">blog post on FlashText</a> which got over 10K claps on Medium :)</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/vi3k6i5/GuidedLDA">GuidedLDA</a></h3>
    <p>GuidedLDA is a modification over simple LDA model. In this implementation we can seed topics. This is used to topics as per user understanding.</p>
    <p> I published a <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-we-changed-unsupervised-lda-to-semi-supervised-guidedlda-e36a95f3a164">blog post on FlashText</a> which got over 500 claps on Medium :)</p>

    <h2>Things I do other than coding:</h2>
    <p>I love <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vi3k6i5/">sketching</a>, listening to music and <a href="https://medium.com/@vi3k6i5">Blogging</a>.</p>
    
    <p>I'm always available to discuss Machine learning, AI, Space, Physics. Let's catch up over <span itemprop="title">Tea</span>. <a href="contact">Drop me a line.</a></p>
